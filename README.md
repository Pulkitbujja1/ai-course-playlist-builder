# AI Course Playlist â€“ Linked List Edition ðŸ§ 

Welcome.

This simple Python project lets you build your own course playlist using a linked list. You can add lessons, mark them as done, remove them, and see whatâ€™s next. Itâ€™s all handled from 
a simple menu you control in the terminal.

This isnâ€™t just code. Itâ€™s a step toward understanding how real systems work behind the scenes â€” think Spotify playlists, Netflix queues, even your todo list app.

### ðŸ”§ What it Does:
- Add lessons to your playlist
- View all the lessons in order
- Remove any lesson by title
- Track which ones you've completed
- Get your next lesson automatically

### ðŸš€ How to Use:
1. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python filename.py
